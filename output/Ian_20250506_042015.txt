Feedback, 26 June 2024
Updates
Busy, good busy
Leadership change was a nonevent, abrupt but not surprised
High level reactions: not overly surprising
Strengths
Player coach balance is tough to strike
Relationships: tried to develop this over time, and this is a people business
Also came from leading DEI committee, caused me to think broadly about trust
Opportunities
When to be more deliberate and active? Active deal management does not lead to learning
Delegate most to the CEOs then MDs, little day to day involvement with junior folks
Three biggest changes: leaner because of RIFs, my time with the team is less because of firm-wide initiatives and 1/2 time NYC move, no team offsite this year for first time
I have more political capital now than ever
Part of it is that I grew up here, headwind but also acknowledging what I can do
External branding: first time ever we're recognizing our DC presence
Next steps
Deliberately explore with team to get more detail and ideas on what to do differently
Action plan with Brian and Steve
Jeannine helps with process more than advice, responsive and close to the issues
Untitled Attachment
Focal question
(DRs) What would make the working environment more effective?
Update from stakeholder call, 14 June 2024
Performance has been very good (17% last year)
A lot going on right now and the team is flat out, they're exhausted
Matt Savino interview, 20 June 2024
Context
MD Head of U.S. Capital Markets (upward peer/partner)
NY based
7 years
Interviewed for Patrick and Will on June 11
I do all the financing parts of deals
Daily interaction, dealing with two challenging investments and lenders
I'm an advisor, deal with sensitive strategy conversations
Worked with him a bunch
Hallmark strengths
So even keeled it's scary: measured
Nice guy, thoughtful
Sees all the playing fields before, knows what the right next move is through experience
Super smart
One or two opportunities
Being more direct more frequently, not so polished and savvy all the time
Deal flow
It's our best vertical
All good investments and the team are great investors
Building the team
Two great MD partners who work for him
Junior people on the team are great
Has made tough decisions around "optimization" and so he manages the talent on his team
Getting things done
At a high level he's very decisive, chooses quickly on a course of action
People skills/read
Pleasure to work with
Poised and polished and polite, used to dancing in conversations
Great soft skills, but I think our whole organization feels being direct
Represent Carlyle
Reputation outside of the firm is that he's a super good guy
Mark Marengo interview, 17 June 2024
Context
JP Morgan, MD co-head of North America Diversified Industries Securities
NY based
Worked with him for over 20 years
I grew up in the A&D world, and witnessed the maturation of Ian over a long period of time
Now lead a bigger broader team but kept the Carlyle relationship
Hallmark strengths
Tough person and a tough negotiator who has gotten more balance over the years
How he's matured, grown into the role, and become a leader from the deal partner
Super smart
Very creative
He's very direct, so I trust him; he's not telling me what I want to hear, he's very candid and transparent (and this has rubbed off on his team as well)
One or two opportunities
Take advantage of the capacity he has freed up by building a talented team
He can take on even more, broader opportunities at Carlyle (which he's doing)
Help his team with the networking and support them
Deal flow
Knows how to put deals together expertly
He was the lead but now empowers his team to do this, so run their respective areas
Team building
Stretches them and puts them in leadership role
Next level down from Ian I have know for over 15 years; I've witnessed him build that next generation of leadership: he has two people leading verticals who are both fantastic, client oriented, detail focused, well coached, and super talented
They seem to know when to involved Ian, when they need his unique support
People skills/read
His ability to read the room is great and he has the ability to be charming
Can spend more time ingratiating himself with management teams; he has a good read of people but can better figure out the connections and spending more time and attention
building trust with them
Feedback
He's fine, he's receptive and accepts it without getting unduly defensive
Represent Carlyle
He is mister A&D, the sector that put Carlyle on the map
Every client knows he is the person to call
Advice
More and more relationship building and networking, within Carlyle and with CEOs
Matt Tait interview, 13 June 2024
Context
CEO ManTech (CEO)
VA based
Carlyle bought us 2 years ago and Ian was part of the conversations
Regular interactions, 3x a quarter (1:1 and then the board meetings)
Hallmark strengths
Came across as high character, high integrity guy (like golfing with Ian, learn how he focuses on the accuracy of his golf scores)
Strategic thinker with a breadth of experience on company boards, good insights into what to focus on to make the journey a success
Doesn't get distracted, focuses on us and our success
Very patient
Very balanced, not a lot of up and down person
One or two opportunities
Almost too humble but it always works for him, I wonder if he fully appreciates the
strengths that he has
Advice
His capability: he should be doing everything he can to embrace that and train up his team to have similar conversations
I don't know what he wants to do in his career, but he's been there and done everything, but he would need to plan out the next level, what are his plans and does he have a successor?
Else
He's our best board member, just because of his thinking
Doug Brandely interview, 12 June 2024
Context
MD for ADG (direct report)
Stakeholder for CSI 3
DC based
19 years
Started in A&D team in 2005
Did more with Adam Palmer before Ian, more closely the last 3 years
Hallmark strengths
Extremely smart (but doesn't let you know it)
Outstanding investment judgment: quick read, able to zero in on the critical factors
Efficient: kills bad opportunities quickly, doesn't waste people time, makes decisions fast
High degree of business acumen, a strategic thinker: outstanding at providing guidance
for our portfolio companies
Industry expert
Leadership style: hands off, operates at a high level, gives the team room to operate
Thinks about how we are structured, how we operate as a team
One or two opportunities
Think about what he as a sector head he is uniquely positioned to do: source deals, build industry relationships...can be more on the front line developing those relationships and winning business (he skews more towards letting the team do this)
Deal flow
See above
Building the team
Gives them space to develop, lets us have the stage
Less direct coaching and teaching, could be more involved and engaged in active coaching during the day to day work, teaching others how he thinks (especially more
junior people)
Good at spotting and evaluating talent
Getting things done
Delegates a lot here, does not ride people but he benefits from team members who are very organized so he doesn't have to crack the whip
People skills/read
Good EQ, solid sense for reading people's emotions and angles
Does not convey much emotion, he's harder to read and even
Feedback
Review twice a year, he asks what I need and what he can do better
Receptive
He was given feedback on his communication skills so he got a comms coach and has improved enormously
Represent Carlyle
Good at collaborating with CEOs
Can work on his industry network
Advice
Even more team building activities (he's done a great job creating cohesiveness but can do even more, being with the team physically in person)
Else
100% results focused: he doesn't care at all about face time or non value added stuff, process, it's all points on the board
Champion for people's careers here, celebrates the performance of people on the team, gets the word out, which generates a lot of loyalty
Martin Sumner interview, 6 June 2024
Context
Sector Head Industrials (peer)
Ian was one of my interviewers at Carlyle 21 years ago
In different groups, joined his group in desperation, Ian gave me the shot
Maintained a friendship, and now I've had a chance to see him on Project Max, with Ian leading the analysis
Hallmark strengths
Highly analytical, wicked smart
Outwardly has no political ambitions, an independent balanced voice who is trustworthy
Seamless when we partner on deals that overlap
Sector head plus, he operates a half a step above the sector head
Developing deep relationships with people and management
Strategic thoughts without making you feel like he's smarter than you
One or two opportunities
Brian had to ask him to play roles, he does not try to gain anything
More confidence in communication (he's clear but shies away a bit from the spotlight and that takes away from his content)
Deal flow
He focuses heavily on negotiations and the 10 ways he can get screwed, very much a chess player and thinks through the landscape; shrewd negotiator
Not the rah rah public figure
Identifies where there is opportunity
Building the team
World class team at working with the government sector
That team is Carlyle's heritage; Ian joined 10 years and gave them the room to develop, the team is very deep
People skills/read
See above
Feedback
Never gave him direct feedback
Represent Carlyle
Tons of credibility, but he's more impressive in a smaller group environment where you
hear his questions and interactions
He doesn't command the room (not bad, a great ambassador but not the onstage guy)
Advice
Realize that when he talks, people listen: embrace it and use it for good, he has enormous credibility and does not have to defer or wait for others, he can lead with his voice and ideas
Be the main act when he's the main act
Else
Their team has had more turnover than other teams, and we had to give him a person; not sure what is driving that (is it the culture, the pace?) so is he managing the group in a way that people want to be there? Is he digging in and actively managing that?
