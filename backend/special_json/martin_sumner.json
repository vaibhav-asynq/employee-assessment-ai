  "areas_to_target": {
    "Performance acceleration.": "Martin is highly respected for his investment acumen and balanced judgment, yet tends to demonstrate hesitancy in driving elevated performance standards. He maintains exceptional personal delivery standards while sometimes showing reluctance to address team performance gaps, occasionally allowing situations to continue without direct intervention. Martin often takes on additional workload rather than establishing clear accountability measures for his team members. Stakeholders note his tendency to prioritize collaborative relationships over addressing performance concerns. This results in team capabilities developing below potential, creating a gap between individual and collective performance that impacts sector results.",
    "Constructive engagement.": "Martin is valued for his thoughtful approach and relationship-building capabilities, though sometimes defers addressing situations that require direct confrontation. He tends to postpone challenging conversations and occasionally allows difficult dynamics to persist, particularly regarding performance feedback and team development. Martin maintains cordial interactions while at times allowing important issues to remain unaddressed. Stakeholders note his inclination to preserve harmonious relationships over addressing conflicts. As a result, critical issues can remain unresolved for extended periods, affecting team dynamics and limiting organizational execution capabilities.",
    "Strategic prioritization.": "Martin is recognized for his exceptional deal expertise and hands-on leadership, yet tends to show imbalance between deal execution and team development responsibilities. He maintains significant personal involvement in transaction management while sometimes providing less structured attention to team capability building. Martin occasionally conducts minimal formal feedback sessions and demonstrates reduced focus on team connectivity in the current environment. This creates missed opportunities for developing broader team capabilities and succession depth, potentially constraining the sector's operational scalability."
