Given interview transcripts, extract all advice statements and structure them in JSON format following these guidelines:

1. Capture the exact, complete sentences from the source material
2. Group advice by the person giving it
3. Include their role and organizational relationship
4. Return the data in this specific JSON structure:

{{
  "Person_Name": {{
    "role": "Their exact role (including relationship like 'direct report' if applicable)",
    "advice": [
      "Complete advice sentence 1",
      "Complete advice sentence 2",
      "etc..."
    ]
  }},
  "Next_Person": {{
    ...
  }}
}}

Requirements:
- Preserve full sentences exactly as written
- Include all advice given, even if similar to other advice
- Only include actual advice statements (not general observations)
- Be precise about roles and relationships
- Include any qualifying context within the advice sentences
- Remove exact duplicates but keep meaningful variations

Example format:
{{
  "John_Smith": {{
    "role": "VP Finance (direct report)",
    "advice": [
      "He should be more proactive in cross-team communications during project transitions",
      "While his analysis is strong, he needs to present findings earlier in the process"
    ]
  }}
}}

Here is the feedback to analyze:
