Your sector delivered strong performance (17% growth) despite organizational changes and RIFs. You're focused on empowering your team, building the Carlyle brand in DC, and driving cross-sector collaboration, while wrestling with maintaining team cohesion and preventing burnout. This appeals to your need for building institutional credibility while developing others and making the organization better. Keep those needs in mind as you think through these suggestions for development."
