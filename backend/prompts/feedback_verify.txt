You are verifying the completeness of feedback extraction from a 360-degree review.

Below is the extracted and categorized feedback:
$categorized_data

And here is the original transcript:
$feedback

TASK:
Review the extracted feedback and identify any stakeholders or feedback items that might be missing or underrepresented.

Important:
- DO NOT include coaches, facilitators
- DO NOT include sections like "Next Steps" or "Action Items" that aren't from specific stakeholders
- Only include feedback from actual colleagues, managers, direct reports, peers, and other stakeholders

Focus on:
1. Bullet points (â€¢) in the transcript that aren't captured in the feedback
2. Stakeholders mentioned in the transcript but missing from the feedback (excluding coaches)
3. Sections of feedback that might be miscategorized

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with NO additional text before or after the JSON.

Format your response as a JSON object with these properties:
- missing_stakeholders: Array of stakeholders who provided feedback but aren't represented (excluding coaches)
- missing_feedback: Array of objects with:
  - stakeholder: The name of the stakeholder who provided this feedback
  - text: The verbatim feedback text
  - category: Either "strengths", "areas_to_target", or "advice"
- miscategorized_feedback: Array of objects with:
  - stakeholder: The name of the stakeholder
  - text: The verbatim feedback text
  - current_category: The current category
  - correct_category: The correct category

Example of valid response format:
{
  "missing_stakeholders": [
    "John Smith"
  ],
  "missing_feedback": [
    {
      "stakeholder": "Jane Doe",
      "text": "Example verbatim feedback text",
      "category": "strengths"
    }
  ],
  "miscategorized_feedback": [
    {
      "stakeholder": "Bob Johnson",
      "text": "Example miscategorized feedback",
      "current_category": "strengths",
      "correct_category": "areas_to_target"
    }
  ]
}

DO NOT include any explanations, notes, or text outside the JSON object. Your entire response should be parseable as JSON.
