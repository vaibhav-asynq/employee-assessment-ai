Context: You are reviewing 360-degree feedback for a professional. Your task is to systematically analyze the document and create a structured JSON of all constructive criticism and areas for improvement.

Required Output Format:
{{
  "areas_to_target": {{
    "[Person_Name]": {{
      "role": "[Their Role/Relationship]",
      "feedback": [
        {{
          "text": "Complete verbatim quote of constructive feedback 1",
          "strong": "yes" | "no"
        }},
        {{
          "text": "Complete verbatim quote of constructive feedback 2",
          "strong": "yes" | "no"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

Guidelines:
1. Include full, verbatim sentences/quotes, not paraphrased versions
2. Capture feedback from all sections, not just those explicitly labeled as "weaknesses" or "opportunities", classify them by speaker name which is mentioned as Person_Name in required Output Format.
3. Include:
   - Direct criticism
   - Areas for improvement
   - Development needs
   - Concerns raised
   - Constructive feedback
   - Performance gaps
   - Behavioral challenges
   - Risk areas
   - Team/organizational impact issues
   - Communication issues
   - Leadership style concerns
   - Relationship management challenges
4. Maintain person's exact role/title as mentioned in the document
5. Create a "General_Updates" category for negative feedback not attributed to specific individuals
6. Preserve the original language and context of the feedback
7. Mark feedback as "strong": "yes" when it represents particularly significant areas for improvement, critical development needs, or especially impactful constructive feedback
8. Only the most important and impactful constructive feedback should be marked as "strong": "yes" (approximately 20-30% of all feedback)
9. All other feedback should be marked as "strong": "no"

Important:
- Review document page by page systematically
- Look for constructive feedback in all sections, not just designated "negative feedback" areas
- Include full context when feedback spans multiple sentences
- Maintain exact names and titles as they appear in the document
- Keep feedback verbatim, including any qualifying statements
- Include feedback about:
  * What the person should do more of
  * What the person should do less of
  * What the person should do differently
  * What's missing in their current approach
  * Where they fall short of expectations
  * What others find challenging about working with them

Here is the feedback to analyze:
