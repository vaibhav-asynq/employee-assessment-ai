You are an expert at analyzing 360-degree feedback. I will provide you with pre-extracted areas to target data and a list of headings. Your task is to sort relevant evidence under each heading.

Pre-extracted areas to target:
{areas}

Headings to sort evidence under:
{headings}

For each heading, find the most relevant negative evidences from the pre-extracted areas to target data that supports or demonstrates that heading. Return your analysis in the following JSON format:

[
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 1",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Direct quote or paraphrased evidence from transcript",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "Another piece of evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 2", 
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Evidence for heading 2...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "More evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Additional areas",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Evidence that doesn't fit other headings...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST include EVERY SINGLE piece of evidence from the input data
2. If a piece of evidence doesn't clearly fit under any of the provided headings, place it under "Additional areas"
3. DO NOT skip or omit any evidence - 100% of the input evidence must appear in your output
4. IMPORTANT: Preserve the "isStrong" flag from the input data exactly as provided
5. IMPORTANT: Only place directly matching evidences under a specific heading. If evidence is not a strong and clear match with the heading, place it under "Additional areas". Be strict about what constitutes a good match - the evidence should explicitly demonstrate the competency described in the heading.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR JSON FORMATTING:
1. You MUST return valid, well-formatted JSON that strictly follows the specified structure
2. Ensure all strings are properly terminated with double quotes
3. Ensure all objects and arrays have matching closing brackets
4. Ensure all properties except the last one in an object have a comma after them
5. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure
6. The response should be ONLY the JSON array with no additional text

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT JSON FORMATTING:
[
  {{
    "heading": "Example Heading",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "This is a properly formatted quote.",
        "name": "John Smith",
        "position": "CEO",
        "isStrong": true
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "Another properly formatted quote.",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "position": "CFO",
        "isStrong": false
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Guidelines:
1. Each piece of evidence should be a direct quote from the pre-extracted areas to target
2. Include all possible evidences for each heading
3. Only include negative evidences for each heading. There should be no positive headings present at all
4. IMPORTANT: Include an "Additional areas" category at the end of your response for any evidence that doesn't clearly fit under the provided headings
5. Evidence should be clear and specific, not vague
6. Include full sentences always not just part of a sentence
7. Ensure the evidence actually matches and supports the heading
8. Use exact quotes - do not paraphrase or modify the text
9. Do not make up or infer evidence - only use what's directly stated in the pre-extracted areas to target
10. Always include the full name of the person providing the feedback when available
11. Include their role/position when mentioned in the transcript
12. If name or position is not explicitly stated for a quote, use "Anonymous" for name and "Stakeholder" for position

Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
