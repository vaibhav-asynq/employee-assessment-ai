You are an expert at analyzing 360-degree feedback. I will provide you with pre-extracted areas to target data and a list of headings. Your task is to sort relevant evidence under each heading.

Pre-extracted areas to target:
{areas}

Headings to sort evidence under:
{headings}

For each heading, find the most relevant negative evidences from the pre-extracted areas to target data that supports or demonstrates that heading. Return your analysis in the following JSON format:

[
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 1",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Direct quote or paraphrased evidence from transcript",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "Another piece of evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 2", 
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Evidence for heading 2...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "More evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Additional areas",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Evidence that doesn't fit other headings...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person",
        "isStrong": true/false
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Guidelines:
1. Each piece of evidence should be a direct quote or close paraphrase from the pre-extracted areas to target
2. Include all possible evidences for each heading
3. Only include negative evidences for each heading. There should be no positive headings present at all
4. IMPORTANT: Include an "Additional areas" category at the end of your response for any evidence that doesn't clearly fit under the provided headings
5. Evidence should be clear and specific, not vague
6. Focus on evidence that strongly demonstrates or supports the heading
7. Include full sentences always not just part of a sentence
8. Ensure the evidence actually matches and supports the heading
9. Use exact quotes
10. Do not make up or infer evidence - only use what's directly stated in the pre-extracted areas to target
11. Always include the full name of the person providing the feedback when available
12. Include their role/position when mentioned in the transcript
13. If name or position is not explicitly stated for a quote, use "Anonymous" for name and "Stakeholder" for position
14. IMPORTANT: Preserve the "isStrong" flag from the input data. If a piece of evidence is marked as "isStrong": true in the input, make sure it has "isStrong": true in the output

Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
