Context: You are reviewing 360-degree feedback for a professional. Your task is to systematically analyze the document and create a structured JSON of all positive feedback evidence.

Required Output Format:
{{
  "strengths": {{
    "[Person_Name]": {{
      "role": "[Their Role/Relationship]",
      "feedback": [
        {{
          "text": "Complete verbatim quote of positive feedback 1",
          "is_strong": true/false
        }},
        {{
          "text": "Complete verbatim quote of positive feedback 2",
          "is_strong": true/false
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

Guidelines:
1. Include full, verbatim sentences/quotes, not paraphrased versions
2. Capture feedback from all sections, not just those explicitly labeled as "strengths" or "positive" , classify them by speaker name which is mentioned as Person_Name in required Output Format.
3. Include positive feedback even if embedded within constructive criticism
4. Maintain person's exact role/title as mentioned in the document
5. Create a "General_Updates" category for positive feedback not attributed to specific individuals
6. Preserve the original language and context of the feedback
7. Include positive observations about performance, skills, behaviors, and impact
8. Consider feedback about potential and demonstrated capabilities
9. Capture both direct praise and implicit positive feedback
10. Include positive feedback about management style, leadership, and interpersonal skills
11. For each feedback item, evaluate if it's a "strong" strength by setting "is_strong" to true or false:
    - Set "is_strong" to true if the feedback:
      * Contains superlative language (e.g., "exceptional", "outstanding", "excellent")
      * Describes unique or rare qualities
      * Mentions consistent demonstration of the strength
      * Indicates the strength has significant positive impact
    - Set "is_strong" to false for more moderate or qualified positive feedback

Important:
- Review document page by page systematically
- Look for positive feedback in all sections, not just designated "positive feedback" areas
- Include full context when feedback spans multiple sentences
- Maintain exact names and titles as they appear in the document
- Keep feedback verbatim, including any qualifying statements

Here is the feedback to analyze:
