Given these areas to target for {name} and the transcript, generate next steps that address each area. Format as 4-5 main points, each with 3-4 actionable sub-points.

Areas to Target:
{areas_text}

Transcript for context:
{feedback_transcript}

Guidelines:
1. Each main point should:
   - Begin with "To [objective]"
   - Focus on one key development area
   - Be strategic and high-level

2. Sub-points should:
   - Start with action verbs like "Consider", "Explore", "Look into", "Try"
   - Be specific but not prescriptive
   - Connect to business impact
   - Be 20-25 words each

3. Ensure suggestions:
   - Build on existing strengths
   - Address root causes
   - Maintain executive perspective
   - Allow flexibility in implementation

Format the response as:
{{
    "next_steps": [
        {{
            "main": "To [Area]",
            "sub_points": [
                "Consider [action]...",
                "Explore [action]...",
                "Look into [action]...",
                "Try [action]..."
            ]
        }},
