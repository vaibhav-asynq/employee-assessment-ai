Report 1 Kelly:
````
To better moderate “loving to be loved.” You know you have both strength and weakness in your
high awareness of others’ views of you and your desire to be judged positively. Be on the lookout
for how that might be impacting the way you engage with people, problems, and opportunities.
• Practice the mental exercise of asking yourself “How would I think about this issue or
approach this situation if I genuinely did not care what people thought of me?”
Compare that answer to what you would usually do and identify where you may be
over-indexing to some approaches over others.
• Strive to be more measured in how you engage people without losing the positive
benefit of your inspirational leadership. Your charisma may raise expectations in others
and be highly motivating but can also intensify disappointment when you are less
encouraging or withdraw attention. If you haven’t already done so, create a clear set of
principles for how you will proactively and effectively manage boundaries in this area.
• To provide more clarity. Start paying close attention to the specifics of the direction you give to
your direct reports and the types of questions or follow up it generates. Occasionally say, “I want
to make sure you have the clarity you need, both in the macro and in the micro. What else should
we or could we talk about to give you what you need?”
• When an output or outcome is not what you expected, get in the habit of trying to find
where you may have played some part in ambiguity or misunderstanding. See these
situations as key opportunities to further refine how you can best set expectations.
• To provide the right amount of feedback and coaching. Touch base with your key team members
one-on-one and ask them to help you calibrate your approach with each. Discuss:
• Am I providing the most useful feedback for you? Is it too much, too little, just right? Is it
the right mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism? What advice do you
have for me to best give you what you need?
• What could I do differently to be more effective at helping to develop you in our one-
on-one conversations? What are shortcuts that I could take that work especially well for
you or distractors that might get in the way of you getting what you most need?
• No matter what each says, make sure that everyone gets at least some ongoing doses of
the praise they deserve and the corrective feedback or advice they need.

Report 2 Martin:

To lead directly and decisively.
o Uncomfortable conversations don’t go away, so some leaders simply make them the
first thing they handle that day. Delaying the interaction just extends the amount of
time you have to worry about it.
o A certain amount of conflict is healthy and most people can tolerate differences of
opinion without taking things personally. Your empathy can help you tune in to people
and steer the conversation in a way that difficult issues can be discussed but done so
in a way that still makes people feel heard and valued.
o Consider reading Dare to Lead: Brave Work, Tough Conversations, Whole Hearts by
Brené Brown. She has some interesting thoughts about the balance among empathy,
connection, and courage.
• To build and leverage the capabilities of the team.
o The Sector Head role is as much a people leadership role as an expert deal making
one. Your team is looking to you for clear direction, expectations, and management.
o Hold people accountable and give them the feedback they deserve. You hold yourself
to an extremely high standard and you know what “excellent” looks like. Push your
team to get there with you.
o Stretch your team members based not only on their current capabilities but their
potential. Think about assigning work that takes advantage of others’ goals and
interests, what lessons they can learn from the project.
o Think about what your team needs in terms of connection and create opportunities to
generate more cohesiveness.
• To focus your role on the highest impact work.
o This is about making conscious decisions about where to focus your time and energy:
take time to think through which battles to fight, which issues to drive, and how to
make a broader impact on the firm.
o Your plate isn’t going to get any bigger, so be very choosy about what you allow to
stay on it.
o Figuratively step out of the Sector Head role and write a job description from scratch.
Outline the ideal role, not the job as it exists today. Think about what the firm needs
most and use that to shape and reframe the job.

Report 3 Harvey:

```
To combat perceptions of having an inner circle. Having trusted advisors is critical but comes
with a cost when it is perceived as overly concentrated in a small group of people.
• Be more obvious and explicit in how you are tapping into the collective expertise, wisdom,
and experience of your senior and extended leadership team. Provide clear evidence that
no one is “always in the room where it happens” or the opposite.
• Have your Chief of Staff provide you ongoing feedback about how often you directly
reference GS. Track it and pick a target for how much you want to reduce it. Similarly,
strive to counter “38th floor” memes that reinforce a narrative of a special group.
• To listen more effectively and better leverage others’ feedback and perspectives. Share that you
“have heard that people don’t think I take feedback as well as I could” with your team. Provide a
different way for them to think about how you handle feedback or engage with disagreement.
Revisit the concept periodically (even very briefly) for the next 6 months.
• Celebrate more often in public, criticize more often in private.
• Make sure you don’t belabor or perseverate on points that remind others that they don’t
want to lose your favor. Try to say more often “Appreciate your points, can continue to
discuss 1-on-1, let’s move on” in group settings.
• To better connect to wider Carlyle. Share with your team that you have heard this feedback and
are open to trying some new approaches. Ask people who you trust most to make suggestions for
small, but effective changes for how you are engaging the broader organization.
• There is an opportunity to better “walk the floor” that longer-tenured Carlyle leaders are
convinced would help here. Create a plan where you can do so in a way that suits you and
allows employees to see the same characteristics your senior team has experienced.
• Either craft a better message about your strategy for the broader firm or challenge your
senior team to do a better job of cascading what you have shared with them. Push the
team to figure out how to address the communication breakdown that currently exists.

Report 4 Ian:

```
To provide more direction.
o Ahead of time, think through the style and approach you want to take in key
situations. Make a conscious decision about when to let your team take the lead,
when to take control yourself, when to facilitate consensus, and when be directive.
o Be clear when speed, or your unique expertise, is needed and when the situation
allows for a more empowering approach.
o Set a high bar and be clear what your expectations are for performance and
excellence.
• To push and empower the team.
o Take an active role in developing the team and holding them accountable. Monitor
their progress and give them frequent feedback to keep them both on track and
learning.
o Address performance issues quickly; they don’t get better on their own. You have
excellent people skills and can manage problems effectively, with tact and support.
o Consider reading The Versatile Leader: Make the Most of Your Strengths Without
Overdoing It by Kaplan and Kaiser. It’s a bit dated but a good resource on rounding out
your natural leadership with additional learned styles.
• To develop a memorable brand.
o You are already being pulled into broader initiatives. Take advantage of those as
opportunities to make new connections throughout the firm and outside of the fund.
o Make sure you have a pithy summary of the sector ready to share at a moment’s
notice. Leaders often have a 30-second “elevator” speech and 60-second “hallway”
speech that contains memorable headlines and summaries for people who ask about
the sector.
o Don’t hold back on your opinions. Your calm, collaborative style works in most
situations, but others require a firm, direct voice. Your knowledge is a key asset: don’t
be afraid to share it because others are asking for it.

Report 5 Pam:

```
To more strategically manage your energy. Think through times in your life when you have gotten
an outsized value for relatively little effort. What did that feel like? What did it allow you to do with
the found time? How can you find ways to get this opportunity more frequently?
• Get familiar with Annie Duke’s work on decision-making. Watch the visual summary of
Thinking in Bets by Doug Neil. Where do you see yourself evaluating your decision-
making based on outcomes instead of your process? Are you managing your energy like a
scarce resource (i.e. as you might budget your money)?
• Combat your natural instinct to see the potential failure points in a given work process.
Step back and analyze just one of your work routines to seek out areas for potential
optimization. Experiment with small changes in behavior such as scheduling only 55 or 25
min meetings on a Monday. Track your gains and share what works with a partner.
• To scale your capability. History is littered with examples of accidental innovations (Penicillin,
Microwaves, Post-it Notes). All occurred because people were experimenting in the name of long-
term improvement. Where in your job can you foster this mindset in those you work with?
• Read The Authenticity Paradox. Embrace the notion that you can be two things at once. It
is possible to have high standards and be less hands on. How can you define your own
identity in ways that allow you to be a catalyst for the good work of others?
• Do you have a range of definitions for the results your team delivers, or is it binary
(perfect/not perfect)? How can you create more space to discuss the expectations of your
stakeholders in more nuanced ways? Try establishing a litmus test for failure in one
situation that feels appropriate. Here is an example that may help.
• To create more synergistic relationships. Your own individual competence is beyond compare and
has been the vehicle that has carried you to great heights. To continue to succeed beyond the
limits of your own capability you will need to multiply the contributions of the people around you.
• Your good intentions are invisible to those around you. To get more from your team you
have to help them see the rationale behind your behavior. This is a two-way street
requiring you to acknowledge that this behavior (well-intended or not) can have a
downside. Familiarize yourself with Multipliers by Liz Wiseman. Take the Accidental
Diminisher quiz to figure out if you may be inadvertently hindering your team.
• Think of your peers more like teammates who are there to help you succeed. If you had a
teammate that never passed you the ball how would you behave in return? Asking your
peers for help allows them to set you up for success. Craft a stakeholder list and think
through two people that you could ask for help in the next 7 days.

Report 6 Denny:

```
To better temper your bias to action.
● When demonstrating a bias to action, make sure that you remember and communicate that
this is a preference for you and that other people might want to be more deliberate.
● Don’t wait for peers or stakeholders to come to you with problems to solve. Instead, begin (or
continue) proactively engaging partners, including senior leaders, in ways that help make you
and your team better at addressing issues before they become problems.
● When demonstrating curiosity with peers and direct reports, don’t forget to signal that you are
most interested in understanding other people’s points of view as much as simple fact-finding
or problem-solving.
● Push yourself to contribute as much thought partnership as tactical solutions.
● To better invest in people and relationships.
● There are many junior members of Rochelle’s team of direct reports both in leadership tenure
and familiarity with Netflix. Make sure that you are doing your part to mentor and guide them.
● Ask people for help or input even if you might not have an acute need. Building those
relationships when it’s not mission-critical will prime the way for when things are more urgent.
● Be sure to share mistakes you have made and good constructive feedback that you have
received. The more you can let others see you are imperfect, the less unapproachable you will
seem. Helping others to learn from you in this way is an added bonus.
● Leverage your skills at developing and pushing your team to make your team of peers in PDP
even better .
● To expand your communication style.
● Don’t be afraid of organizational boundaries and swim lanes. Make sure that you are looking
farther up in the organization or upstream in a process to offer your influence, insights, and
thought partnership.
● Seek out more opportunities to speak to larger audiences of stakeholders. Leverage your
natural ability to synthesize information and use metaphors to help create connections and
stories that stick in people’s minds.
● Be yourself and let your personality shine through. Increasing authenticity builds trust and
makes others feel more comfortable approaching you.
● Discussing with peers how you are approaching common goals before a project is done will
help influence them earlier in the process.
● Don't limit your attempts at approachability to work-related situations. Be open and
approachable in informal settings as well, such as during breaks or social events.
