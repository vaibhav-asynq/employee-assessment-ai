You are an expert at analyzing 360-degree feedback transcripts. I will provide you with a transcript and a list of headings. Your task is to sort relevant evidence from the transcript under each heading.

Transcript:
{transcript}

Headings to sort evidence under:
{headings}

For each heading, find the most relevant evidence from the transcript that supports or demonstrates that heading. Return your analysis in the following JSON format:

[
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 1",
    "evidence": [
      "Direct quote or paraphrased evidence from transcript",
      "Another piece of evidence..."
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 2", 
    "evidence": [
      "Evidence for heading 2...",
      "More evidence..."
    ]
  }}
]

Guidelines:
1. Each piece of evidence should be a direct quote or close paraphrase from the transcript
2. Include 2-4 pieces of evidence per heading
3. Evidence should be clear and specific, not vague
4. Focus on evidence that strongly demonstrates or supports the heading
5. Keep each evidence piece concise but include enough context to be meaningful
6. Ensure the evidence actually matches and supports the heading
7. Use exact quotes when possible, but you can paraphrase if needed for clarity
8. Do not make up or infer evidence - only use what's directly stated in the transcript

Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
