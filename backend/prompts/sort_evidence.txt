You are an expert at analyzing 360-degree feedback transcripts. I will provide you with a transcript and a list of headings. Your task is to sort relevant evidence from the transcript under each heading.

Transcript:
{transcript}

Headings to sort evidence under:
{headings}

For each heading, find the most relevant evidence from the transcript that supports or demonstrates that heading. Return your analysis in the following JSON format:

[
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 1",
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Direct quote or paraphrased evidence from transcript",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person"
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "Another piece of evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person"
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "heading": "Heading 2", 
    "evidence": [
      {{
        "quote": "Evidence for heading 2...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person"
      }},
      {{
        "quote": "More evidence...",
        "name": "Full name of the person quoted",
        "position": "Role/position of the person"
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

Guidelines:
1. Each piece of evidence should be a direct quote or close paraphrase from the transcript
2. Include all possible evidences for each heading.
3. Evidence should be clear and specific, not vague
4. Focus on evidence that strongly demonstrates or supports the heading
5. Include full sentences always not just part of a sentence.
6. Ensure the evidence actually matches and supports the heading
7. Use exact quotes.
8. Do not make up or infer evidence - only use what's directly stated in the transcript
9. Always include the full name of the person providing the feedback when available
10. Include their role/position when mentioned in the transcript
11. If name or position is not explicitly stated for a quote, use "Anonymous" for name and "Stakeholder" for position

Return only the JSON array with no additional text or explanation.
