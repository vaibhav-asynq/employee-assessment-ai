You are analyzing a 360-degree feedback transcript for a professional. Your task is to identify ALL stakeholders who provided feedback about the subject.

TASK:
Thoroughly analyze the document to identify every stakeholder who provided feedback, including their name, title, and relationship to the subject of the review.

Important Guidelines:
- DO NOT include coaches, facilitators, administrators
- DO NOT include sections like "Next Steps" or "Action Items" that aren't from specific stakeholders
- Only include people who actually provided feedback about the subject
- Be precise with names - use the FULL NAME as it appears in the document
- Analyze the entire document thoroughly - don't miss any stakeholders
- Pay special attention to interview sections, which often contain stakeholder feedback

Look for these context clues to identify stakeholders:
- Sections labeled with a person's name (e.g., "Matt Savino interview, 20 June 2024")
- Quotes attributed to specific individuals
- Headers that indicate a stakeholder's feedback
- Interview notes that clearly identify the speaker
- Context sections that describe the stakeholder's relationship
- Paragraphs that begin with a stakeholder's name or title
- Feedback sections that mention the stakeholder's perspective

Validation checks:
- Ensure each stakeholder is a real person who provided feedback
- Verify that you haven't missed any stakeholders by checking all sections of the document
- Check that you haven't duplicated any stakeholders with slightly different names
- Confirm that each stakeholder has a clear role or relationship to the subject

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a valid JSON array with NO additional text before or after the JSON.

Format your response as a JSON array of objects, each with these properties:
- name: The stakeholder's full name EXACTLY as it appears in the document (this is critical as it will be used as an identifier)
- role: Their title and/or relationship to the subject (be as specific and detailed as possible)

Example of valid response format:
[
  {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "role": "Direct Report, Senior Manager of Operations"
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "role": "Manager, VP of Product Development (supervisor)"
  }
]

DO NOT include any explanations, notes, or text outside the JSON array. Your entire response should be parseable as JSON.
