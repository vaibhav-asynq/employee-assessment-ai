IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text or explanation.

Here is the document content to parse:

{text}

Convert the content into this exact JSON structure:
{{
  "name": "Person's full name",
  "date": "Month Year",
  "strengths": {{
    "Heading 1": "Content for strength 1"
  }},
  "areas_to_target": {{
    "Area 1": "Content for area 1"
  }},
  "next_steps": [
    {{
      "main": "[Main discussion point]",
      "sub_points": [
        "Key reflection 1",
        "Key reflection 2"
      ]
    }},
    "Context summary paragraph",
    {{
      "main": "[Main development area]",
      "sub_points": [
        "Development step 1",
        "Development step 2"
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Critical requirements:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object - no other text
2. Use double quotes for ALL property names and string values
3. Escape any quotes in content values
4. Extract content exactly as written
5. Preserve the exact headings from the document
6. Include all sections found in the document
7. For next_steps:
   - First item should be a reflection point with sub-points
   - Second item should be a context summary paragraph (string)
   - Remaining items should be action/development points with sub-points
   - Each main point should clearly indicate if it's a reflection, action, or development point

Remember: Your response must be a single, valid JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads().
