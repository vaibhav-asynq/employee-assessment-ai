          "feedback": "[Full verbatim feedback sentence]",
          "source": "[Name of person providing feedback]",
          "role": "[Role/title of person]",
          "is_strong": true/false
        }}
      ]
    }},
    "Additional strengths.": {{
      "evidence": [
        {{
          "feedback": "[Feedback that doesn't fit other categories]",
          "source": "[Name of person providing feedback]",
          "role": "[Role/title of person]"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

Guidelines for categorization:

Category Selection:
- Create categories that reflect enduring leadership qualities
- Use professional, positive terminology
- Focus on demonstrated strengths
- Group related feedback themes
- Consider both technical and behavioral strengths
- Identify unique differentiators
- Add the full stop at the end of the headings. Examples: Selfless style.  Business leadership.

Organization Principles:
1. Identify core strength themes in the provided strengths
2. Create appropriate category headings
3. Group specific evidence under each strength
4. Preserve source attribution and role context
5. Note patterns of consistent feedback
6. Highlight unique or distinctive qualities
7.⁠ ⁠Do not use underscore in headings

Special Instructions:
- IMPORTANT: After categorizing strengths into the main categories, review all input strengths again and identify any that don't clearly fit into your chosen categories.
- Place ALL uncategorized content into a category called "Additional strengths." - this category MUST be included in the output even if it's empty.
- The "Additional strengths." category should contain any feedback that doesn't align well with your main categories.
- Maintain the original wording, source attribution, and roles from the input.
- IMPORTANT: Preserve the "is_strong" flag from the pre-extracted strengths data. If a feedback item has "is_strong": true in the input, make sure it has "is_strong": true in the output.
- Do not discard any evidence - ensure ALL input strengths are categorized.
- Double-check that every piece of feedback from the input appears somewhere in your output.
- Write the source name properly spaced, without underscores.
