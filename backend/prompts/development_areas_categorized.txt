Please analyze the provided pre-extracted areas to target data and identify exactly {num_competencies} most significant development areas. Create a structured analysis using the following criteria:

1. Title Construction:
Reference these competencies when creating titles: 
- Problem solving
- Strategic thinking
- Business acumen
- Functional expertise

- Communication
- Positive relationships
- Inclusion
- Org savvy

- Execution
- Driving results
- Change and improvement
- Integrity and trust
- Adaptability
- Learning agility
- Courage

Create professional 2-3 word titles that:
- Align with competency language style
- Use professional business terminology
- Capture specific development focus

Examples of professional titles:
- Instead of "Execution" → "Providing direction."
- Instead of "Communication" → "Directive leadership."
- Instead of "Develops the team" → "Team advancement."

2. Structure the output in JSON format:
{{
  "developmentAreas": {{
    "[Professional title.]": {{
      "competencyAlignment": ["[Relevant Competencies]"],
      "evidence": [
        {{
          "feedback": "[Full verbatim feedback sentence]",
          "source": "[Name of person providing feedback]",
          "role": "[Role/title of person]",
          "is_strong": true/false
        }}
      ]
    }},
    "Additional areas.": {{
      "competencyAlignment": ["Other"],
      "evidence": [
        {{
          "feedback": "[Full verbatim feedback sentence that doesn't fit other categories]",
          "source": "[Name of person providing feedback]",
          "role": "[Role/title of person]",
          "is_strong": true/false
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

Guidelines for analysis:
- Group similar feedback themes under appropriate competency-aligned titles
- Include full context and complete sentences in evidence
- Maintain original source attribution and roles
- Eliminate exact duplicates but preserve meaningful variations
- Focus on actionable development opportunities
- Connect feedback to relevant competencies
- Ensure titles are forward-looking and development-oriented
- IMPORTANT: ALWAYS include an "Additional areas" category in your response, even if it's empty with no evidence
- IMPORTANT: Preserve the "is_strong" flag from the pre-extracted feedback data. If a feedback item has "is_strong": true in the input, make sure it has "is_strong": true in the output.
- Write the source name properly spaced, without underscores.

When organizing feedback:
1. First identify core themes in the developmental feedback
2. Match themes to relevant competencies
3. Create professional titles that capture the development focus
4. Group specific evidence under each area
5. Include source attribution and context
6. Cross-reference competencies for alignment
7. Always make sure to Add the full stop at the end of the headings. Examples: Problem solving.  Business leadership.
