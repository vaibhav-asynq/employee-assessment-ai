You are analyzing a 360-degree feedback transcript for a professional. Your task is to extract ALL feedback provided by a specific stakeholder.

TASK:
For stakeholder $name ($role), extract EVERY piece of feedback that was provided by THIS stakeholder, maintaining the original wording and ensuring complete coverage.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST use the EXACT name "$name" in your response JSON - do not substitute any other name
- You MUST use the EXACT role "$role" in your response JSON - do not change it
- Extract ONLY feedback that can be clearly attributed to $name specifically
- Do NOT include generic feedback or feedback from other stakeholders
- If you cannot find feedback specifically from this stakeholder, return an empty feedback array
- Ignore any "Next Steps" or "Action Items" sections
- Be EXHAUSTIVE - extract EVERY single piece of feedback, no matter how small

Context Analysis Guidelines:
1. Analyze the ENTIRE document to find ALL feedback from this stakeholder
2. Pay special attention to sections that explicitly mention $name as the source
3. Look for interview sections with this stakeholder
4. Consider the context window around mentions of the stakeholder's name
5. Examine paragraph boundaries and section headers for attribution clues
6. Break down compound feedback into individual points when appropriate

Extraction Guidelines:
1. Include EVERY bullet point (â€¢) or numbered item that appears to be from this stakeholder
2. Include EVERY sentence that contains feedback about the subject
3. Capture complete sentences/thoughts
4. Preserve the original language exactly
5. Note the page number or section where each piece of feedback appears
6. Be thorough - don't miss any feedback items

EXAMPLES OF GOOD EXTRACTION:
For stakeholder "John Smith (Manager)":
- If the document says "John Smith noted: 'She is an excellent communicator'", include this
- If a section is labeled "Feedback from John Smith" or "Manager's Assessment", include items from this section
- If there's a quote attributed to "John", and he's the only John mentioned, include it
- If a section begins with "John Smith interview" followed by bullet points, include all relevant bullets
- If feedback appears in different sections of the document but is clearly from this stakeholder, include all instances

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT EXTRACTION:
- Do NOT include feedback from "Jane Smith" when looking for "John Smith"
- Do NOT include general feedback not specifically attributed to this stakeholder
- Do NOT include feedback that could be from multiple people
- Do NOT substitute "Jill" or any other name in place of "$name"
- Do NOT miss feedback items that are clearly from this stakeholder

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with NO additional text before or after the JSON.

Format your response as a JSON object with these properties:
- name: The EXACT stakeholder name "$name" (copy this value exactly as provided)
- role: The EXACT stakeholder role "$role" (copy this value exactly as provided)
- feedback: An array of feedback items, each with:
  - text: The verbatim feedback text
  - location: Page number or section identifier (if available)

Example of valid response format:
{
  "name": "$name",
  "role": "$role",
  "feedback": [
    {
      "text": "Example verbatim feedback text specific to $name",
      "location": "Page 1"
    },
    {
      "text": "Another example feedback item from $name",
      "location": "Strengths section"
    }
  ]
}

DO NOT include any explanations, notes, or text outside the JSON object. Your entire response should be parseable as JSON.
