Rather than ""How are you feeling? Are you feeling motivated"" try ""Tell me about a time where you felt most or least motivated?"" and ask questions within that. E.g. motivated by competition -> ""Given that we're in a situation where that momentum is low, how can we get you to feel that type of motivation?""

Ask them about their best day at work in the last year, when they feel like they're operating at their best - what is specifically happening that motivates them? Autonomy? Mastery?","Keep a note on every person on your team where you're listening to what is idiosyncratically improtant to that person (not just money or wanting to be good at their job). If you show that you understand that there is something specific that motivates them, it will make a difference.

The hours you work send a message to the team. On the one hand, you lead by example and are seen as committed and hard working.

As leaders are more and more powerful, they can feel less human if they don’t offer explicit signals that they have struggles like everyone else.
