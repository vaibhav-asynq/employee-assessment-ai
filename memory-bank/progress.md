# Progress: Employee Assessment AI

## What Works
Based on the project structure and files, the following functionality appears to be implemented:

1. **Backend Infrastructure**:
   - FastAPI server setup with modular router structure
   - Database integration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic migrations
   - Authentication system with JWT
   - Enhanced PDF processing pipeline using Aspose.Words
   - Standalone PDF-to-text conversion utility

2. **Feedback Processing**:
   - PDF document upload and text extraction with Aspose.Words
   - Word-based chunking (1500 words per chunk with 200 words overlap)
   - Feedback identification and stakeholder extraction
   - Feedback categorization and verification
   - Strength and development area identification

3. **Frontend Framework**:
   - Next.js application with TypeScript
   - Component structure for interview analysis
   - Zustand state management
   - API integration with backend services
   - UI components using Shadcn UI and Tailwind

4. **Core Features**:
   - Document upload interface
   - Feedback display and management
   - Competency generation
   - Evidence sorting and categorization
   - Snapshot saving and loading

## What's Left to Build
Areas that may need further development:

1. **Enhanced Analysis**:
   - Refinement of LLM prompts for more accurate analysis
   - Improved categorization of strengths and development areas
   - More sophisticated evidence sorting algorithms

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Comprehensive report templates
   - Customizable report formats
   - Export functionality for different formats

3. **User Experience**:
   - Streamlined workflow for assessment process
   - Improved visualization of assessment data
   - Enhanced snapshot comparison features

4. **System Robustness**:
   - Expanded test coverage
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance optimization for large documents

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Trend analysis across multiple assessments
   - Collaborative assessment capabilities
   - Integration with other HR systems

## Current Status
The project appears to be in active development with a functional core system:

- **Backend**: Core functionality implemented with ongoing refinements
- **Frontend**: Main components built with active UI/UX improvements
- **Integration**: Working end-to-end flow with opportunities for optimization
- **Testing**: Test framework in place with some test cases implemented

## Known Issues
Potential issues based on file structure and naming:

1. PDF processing improvements with Aspose.Words need validation with various document formats
2. Word-based chunking approach needs testing with different document types and sizes
3. LLM-based analysis may require further tuning for accuracy
4. Evidence sorting algorithms may need refinement
5. Snapshot functionality may need additional validation
6. Frontend components may require optimization for performance

## Evolution of Project Decisions
Key decision points and their evolution:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Started with modular backend design
   - Evolved to include comprehensive prompt-based LLM integration
   - Added snapshot functionality for state persistence
   - Improved PDF processing with Aspose.Words and word-based chunking

2. **PDF Processing**:
   - Initially used PyPDF2 for basic PDF text extraction with page-based chunking
   - Upgraded to Aspose.Words for improved text extraction capabilities
   - Implemented word-based chunking (1500 words/chunk) for more consistent LLM input sizes

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Initial focus on basic feedback extraction
   - Expanded to multi-stage processing pipeline
   - Added sophisticated categorization and evidence sorting

4. **Frontend Approach**:
   - Built on Next.js with TypeScript
   - Implemented Zustand for state management
   - Developed custom hooks for specific functionality
   - Created specialized components for different aspects of assessment

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Implemented staged output verification
   - Created test cases for critical functionality
   - Established output comparison for validation
